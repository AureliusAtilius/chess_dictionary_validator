# chess_dictionary_validator
This script contains a function called isValidChessBoard() that takes in a dictionary with chess coordinates and the pieces on them. It checks to see if the board detailed in the dictionary is valid by checking: the number of kings per side, the number of pawns per side, the total number of pieces, and to check if a piece is on an invalid square, e.g. "9z". If all these requirements are met then the function returns True.
